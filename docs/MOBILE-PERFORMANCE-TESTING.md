## T125: Profile Animation FPS in Chrome DevTools

### Setup Remote Debugging

#### Android:
1. Connect device via USB
2. Chrome ‚Üí `chrome://inspect` ‚Üí Enable port forwarding
3. Open your app on mobile device
4. Click "Inspect" in Chrome DevTools

#### Desktop Testing:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Enable Device Toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Select device (iPhone SE, Pixel 5, etc.)
4. Throttle CPU: 4x slowdown for mid-range simulation

### Performance Profiling Steps

1. **Open Performance Tab** in DevTools

2. **Start Recording:**
   - Click Record button (‚óè)
   - Navigate to `/g/[test-greeting-id]`
   - Let animation complete fully
   - Stop recording

3. **Analyze FPS:**
   - Look for FPS chart at top of timeline
   - Green bars = 60fps
   - Yellow bars = 30-60fps
   - Red bars = <30fps (jank!)

4. **Check Frame Timing:**
   - Hover over frames to see individual frame times
   - Target: <16.67ms per frame (60fps)
   - Warning: >33.33ms per frame (30fps)

5. **Identify Performance Issues:**
   - Look for "Long Tasks" (>50ms)
   - Check for "Forced Reflow" warnings
   - Identify expensive JavaScript execution
   - Look for "Composite" operations

### DevTools Console Metrics

Our performance monitoring automatically logs metrics in development:

```javascript
// Open Console tab to see:
üé≠ Animation Performance: DiwaliTemplate
‚è±Ô∏è  Total Time: 6542ms
üìä Average FPS: 58
‚ö° Frame Times: min=14.2ms, max=19.8ms, avg=16.1ms
‚ö†Ô∏è  Jank: 12 frames (3.2%)
‚úÖ Smooth: Yes
```

### Screenshots to Capture

1. FPS chart showing full animation
2. Bottom-Up call tree showing expensive functions
3. Main thread timeline with long tasks highlighted
4. Memory usage over time

## T126: Optimize Animations if Jank Detected

### Jank Detection Criteria

**Jank is detected when:**
- Average FPS < 55
- Jank percentage > 5%
- Individual frames > 20ms
- Visible stuttering to human eye

### Optimization Checklist

If jank is detected, apply these optimizations in order:

#### Level 1: Quick Wins
- [ ] Reduce sparkle count from 12 to 6
- [ ] Disable shadows on mobile (already implemented)
- [ ] Reduce blur effects
- [ ] Simplify gradient backgrounds

#### Level 2: Animation Tweaks
- [ ] Reduce diya count from 5 to 3
- [ ] Increase stagger delay to reduce concurrent tweens
- [ ] Use `will-change: transform` on animated elements
- [ ] Replace `filter` animations with `opacity`

#### Level 3: Aggressive Optimization
- [ ] Disable flame flicker on low-end devices
- [ ] Use static diya images instead of CSS shapes
- [ ] Reduce animation duration (8s ‚Üí 5s)
- [ ] Remove sparkle animations entirely

#### Level 4: Progressive Enhancement (T127)
- [ ] Detect device performance tier
- [ ] Apply tier-specific settings:
  - High: Full animation (current)
  - Medium: Reduced particles, no shadows
  - Low: Minimal animation, fast duration

### Code Changes Example

```typescript
// In DiwaliTemplate.tsx
const devicePerf = detectDevicePerformance();
const sparkleCount = devicePerf === 'high' ? 12 : devicePerf === 'medium' ? 6 : 0;

// Adjust diya count
const diyaCount = devicePerf === 'low' ? 3 : 5;
```

---

## T127: Progressive Enhancement Implementation

### Device Performance Tiers

Our `lib/performance.ts` automatically detects device tiers:

```typescript
import { detectDevicePerformance, getAnimationSettings } from '@/lib/performance';

const tier = detectDevicePerformance(); // 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
const settings = getAnimationSettings(tier);
```

### Tier Definitions

#### High Performance
- **Devices**: iPhone 12+, Snapdragon 855+, 8GB+ RAM
- **Settings**:
  - 60 FPS target
  - All visual effects enabled
  - Full particle count (50)
  - Shadow and blur effects
  - Complex animations

#### Medium Performance
- **Devices**: iPhone 8-11, Snapdragon 665-845, 4-8GB RAM
- **Settings**:
  - 45 FPS target
  - Reduced particles (25)
  - No shadows or blur
  - Simplified animations
  - Faster duration

#### Low Performance
- **Devices**: iPhone 6-7, Snapdragon <665, <4GB RAM, or Slow 3G
- **Settings**:
  - 30 FPS target (acceptable degradation)
  - No particles
  - No decorative effects
  - Essential animations only
  - Fast duration (0.5x)

### Testing Progressive Enhancement

   - [ ] 60 FPS maintained

2. **Test on Mid-Range Device (iPhone SE, Pixel 5a):**
   - [ ] Reduced particle count
   - [ ] Shadows disabled
   - [ ] 45+ FPS maintained

3. **Test on Low-End Device (iPhone 6s, old Android):**
   - [ ] Minimal particles
   - [ ] Fast animations
   - [ ] 30+ FPS (graceful degradation)

4. **Test Reduced Motion:**
   - System Settings ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Reduce Motion ‚Üí ON
   - [ ] Animations are simplified or static
   - [ ] Content still readable
   - [ ] User preference respected

### Force Performance Tier (Testing)

```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.setItem('wysh_force_performance', 'low');
location.reload();
```

Options: `'high'`, `'medium'`, `'low'`

## Automated Performance Testing

### Save Test Results

Our performance monitoring saves results to localStorage:

```javascript
import { getPerformanceTests } from '@/lib/performance';

// View all test results
const tests = getPerformanceTests();
console.table(tests);
```

### Export Results

```javascript
// Copy to clipboard for reporting
const tests = getPerformanceTests();
copy(JSON.stringify(tests, null, 2));
```
