# Feature Specification: Enhanced Festival Greeting Animations

**Feature Branch**: `002-enhance-festival-animations`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Enhance Wysh greeting card animations for three festivals: Diwali, New Year, and Pongal with next-level, visually stunning animations using GSAP 3.13+ features including particle systems, motion paths, and timeline orchestration."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Diwali Festival Lighting Animation Experience (Priority: P1)

As a Diwali greeting creator, when I select the Diwali template, I want to see spectacular fireworks and lighting effects that capture the essence of the festival of lights, so that my recipient feels the joy and celebration of Diwali.

This story prioritizes the cultural core of Diwali - the triumph of light over darkness - through progressive animation phases that build emotional engagement.

**Why this priority**: Diwali is the most widely celebrated festival among target users, and lighting effects are the most recognizable visual signature of the holiday. Delivers foundational animation system that other festivals build upon.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by (1) loading a Diwali greeting, (2) observing the 8-10 second animation sequence with all phases present, (3) verifying 60fps performance on target devices, (4) confirming recipient can view the animation smoothly on mobile.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a creator selects Diwali template, **When** animation plays, **Then** dark background fades in with multiple diyas appearing in staggered sequence (0-2s)
2. **Given** diyas have appeared, **When** animation continues (2-6s), **Then** fireworks launch from bottom with visible particle bursts in 360-degree pattern

### User Story 4 - Relationship Context Animation Adaptation (Priority: P2)

As a greeting creator, when I create a greeting for different relationships (professional, family, friends, romantic), I want the animation intensity and style to adapt appropriately, so that my greeting maintains the right tone for the recipient.

This story ensures animations respect social context and maintain professional appropriateness where needed.

**Why this priority**: Relationship context is essential for cultural sensitivity and professional use cases. Enables single animation system to serve multiple contexts. Builds on animation implementation from P1 stories.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by (1) creating greetings for different relationship types, (2) verifying animation intensity reduction for professional relationships (30% reduction), (3) confirming color variations apply correctly, (4) checking that family relationships show full intensity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** animation plays for professional relationship, **When** animation displays, **Then** animation intensity reduces by 30% through slower speeds or reduced particle counts
2. **Given** professional relationship animation plays, **When** colors render, **Then** muted color variants display instead of vibrant palette
3. **Given** professional relationship animation plays, **When** message appears, **Then** tone and presentation emphasize respect and formality
4. **Given** animation plays for family relationship, **When** animation displays, **Then** full animation intensity and traditional color palettes appear
5. **Given** animation plays for friends relationship, **When** animation displays, **Then** maximum animation energy appears with vibrant color saturation
6. **Given** animation plays for romantic relationship, **When** animation displays, **Then** softer animations appear with elegant transitions and pastel-tinted color variants

### User Story 5 - Animation Preview Before Finalizing Greeting (Priority: P2)

As a greeting creator, before I finalize and share my greeting, I want to see a full preview of the animation so I can verify it looks good, so that I'm confident sharing it with my recipient.

This story supports the creation workflow by enabling creators to preview animations before committing to sharing.

**Why this priority**: Improves creator confidence and reduces recipients receiving animations they didn't intend. Builds on animation implementation from P1 stories but adds UI workflow integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by (1) reaching template selection step in creation flow, (2) viewing animation preview, (3) verifying play/pause/replay controls work, (4) confirming animation can be viewed multiple times.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** creator is in template selection step, **When** template is displayed, **Then** full animation plays automatically
2. **Given** animation is playing, **When** creator clicks pause button, **Then** animation pauses at current frame
3. **Given** animation is paused, **When** creator clicks play button, **Then** animation resumes from pause point
4. **Given** animation has finished, **When** creator clicks replay button, **Then** animation restarts from beginning
5. **Given** animation is previewing, **When** animation finishes, **Then** replay button appears for creator to trigger restart

### User Story 6 - Reusable Fireworks Template for Multiple Celebrations (Priority: P2)

As a greeting creator, when I select the Fireworks template, I want a versatile animation system that I can use for both Diwali and New Year celebrations (or any other festive occasion), so that I have flexibility in choosing celebration themes without being limited to festival-specific templates.

This story enables a reusable, configurable fireworks animation that can adapt to different celebration contexts through customizable colors, timing, and intensity patterns.

**Why this priority**: Provides flexibility for users who want fireworks without a specific festival context, reduces code duplication across Diwali and New Year templates, and creates a foundation for future celebration templates. Demonstrates animation system extensibility and maintainability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by (1) loading a greeting with Fireworks template, (2) observing fireworks animation with customizable colors, (3) verifying animation works with different color palettes and timing configurations, (4) confirming fireworks can be configured for different celebration contexts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a creator selects Fireworks template, **When** animation plays, **Then** fireworks launch from bottom with configurable burst patterns
2. **Given** Fireworks template is used for Diwali context, **When** animation renders, **Then** fireworks use Diwali colors (Orange #FF6B35, Gold #FFA500, Red #DC143C, White #FFFFFF)
3. **Given** Fireworks template is used for New Year context, **When** animation renders, **Then** fireworks use New Year colors (Blue #1E90FF, Red #FF1493, Gold #FFD700, Green #32CD32, Purple #9370DB, Silver #C0C0C0)
4. **Given** Fireworks template receives burst count parameter, **When** animation plays, **Then** correct number of fireworks (5-7 or custom) launch and explode
5. **Given** Fireworks template receives particle count parameter, **When** animation plays, **Then** each firework renders specified particle count (200-500 total) with performance optimization
6. **Given** Fireworks template receives duration parameter, **When** animation plays, **Then** animation completes in specified duration (8-12 seconds) with proportional timing for all phases
7. **Given** Fireworks animation plays on mid-range device, **When** performance is measured, **Then** animation maintains 60fps with 360-degree radial particle distribution
8. **Given** Fireworks template reaches end of animation, **When** animation completes, **Then** particles fade with gravity simulation and optional looped background fireworks
9. **Given** device has prefers-reduced-motion enabled, **When** Fireworks template plays, **Then** simple flash-burst animation displays instead with minimal motion
10. **Given** Fireworks template is used with relationship context, **When** animation renders, **Then** intensity and colors adapt based on relationship type (professional/family/friends/romantic)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when animation completes but user hasn't interacted? (Looped subtle animation should continue indefinitely)
- What happens when low-end device cannot maintain 60fps? (Animation should gracefully degrade with reduced particle counts, user should still see recognizable animation)
- How does system handle prefers-reduced-motion on browsers that don't support it? (Fallback to standard animation with option to pause)
- What happens when recipient views greeting on very slow network? (Animation assets should be lazy-loaded, placeholder shown while loading)
- How are animations handled on devices that disable hardware acceleration? (Fallback to simpler animation or canvas-based rendering)
- What happens if animation code errors during playback? (Error is caught, simple fallback animation displays with message visible)
- How does system handle rapid replay button clicks? (Animation should be debounced to prevent multiple simultaneous animations)
- What happens on very small screens (mobile < 280px)? (Animation scales down appropriately, all visual elements remain visible)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Animation frame rate MUST maintain 60fps on target devices (mid-range Android 2021+) measured via browser DevTools Performance tab - target: 0 dropped frames during 10-second animation
- **SC-002**: Greeting page MUST load in under 2 seconds on 4G connection - measured via Lighthouse Network tab with simulated 4G throttling
- **SC-003**: Animation completion rate MUST reach 90% or higher - target: 90%+ viewers watch entire animation without pausing or skipping
- **SC-004**: Animation share rate MUST reach 80% or higher - target: 80%+ creators share greeting after viewing animation preview
- **SC-005**: Lighthouse performance score MUST exceed 85 on mobile devices - measured via Google Lighthouse with mobile device emulation
- **SC-006**: User feedback rating for "Animation quality" MUST exceed 4.5/5.0 - measured via post-sharing feedback collection
- **SC-007**: File size per animation template MUST not exceed 500KB - measured via network tab for animation code and associated assets

- **SC-010**: Paint time per animation frame MUST not exceed 8ms on mid-range devices - measured via Chrome DevTools Performance tab

## Assumptions

The specification makes the following informed assumptions:

1. **Particle Rendering**: Canvas-based rendering will be used for particles (200-500 total) to achieve 60fps performance. DOM-based rendering would not achieve target performance.
2. **Animation Libraries**: GSAP 3.12+ will be used as specified; no alternative animation libraries will be considered during implementation.
3. **Browser Support**: Modern browser support (last 2 versions) is acceptable; IE11 support is not required.
4. **Mobile Testing**: Physical device testing on mid-range Android devices will be conducted; emulator-based testing alone is insufficient for validating 60fps performance.
5. **SVG DrawSVG Plugin**: GSAP DrawSVG plugin will be available for Pongal kolam drawing animation; if unavailable, SVG.js or similar library will be used as substitute.
6. **Relationship Context Data**: Relationship type information is already available from greeting creation flow and stored in greeting data model; no schema changes required.
7. **Prefers-Reduced-Motion Fallback**: Simple fade-in and text reveal animations require no additional dependencies beyond CSS and basic JavaScript.
8. **Color Accuracy**: Festival colors specified in hex values are acceptable for cultural representation; no color management system required.
9. **Audio**: No audio/sound effects are included (explicitly out of scope for this feature).
10. **Animation Assets**: All animations will be code-generated with GSAP; no pre-rendered video or image sequences required.

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope and will not be implemented in this feature:

- Sound effects or background music (future enhancement)
- User-customizable animation parameters (future enhancement)
- Additional festival templates beyond Diwali, New Year, Pongal
- Interactive elements where user controls animation progression
- Video-based animations (must be code-based with GSAP)
- Analytics dashboard for animation engagement metrics (future enhancement)
- A/B testing different animation variants (future enhancement)
- Multi-language support beyond English text

## Notes

- This specification focuses on WHAT animations should do and deliver, not HOW they should be implemented architecturally
- All timing values (8-10s, 10-12s) are targets for narrative flow; exact timing can vary by 0.5s based on performance optimization
- Particle counts are guidelines with flexibility for performance optimization on different devices
- Cultural authenticity is a hard requirement, especially for Pongal; consultation with cultural experts during implementation is recommended
- The relationship context adaptation system creates a foundation for future festival animations to follow the same pattern
