## Specification Updates

### Files Modified

**Primary**: `/specs/002-enhance-festival-animations/spec.md` (346 lines, +3 lines)

#### Updates Applied

1. **Clarifications Section** (NEW)
   - Added `## Clarifications` section with `### Session 2025-10-17` subheading
   - Documented all 5 Q&A pairs with canonical answers
   - Format: Specifications wiki standard (`- Q: <question> → A<N>: <answer>`)

2. **Assumptions Section** (UPDATED - 13 entries)
   - Updated Assumption 1: Canvas 2D particle rendering with GPU acceleration spec
   - Updated Assumption 5: DrawSVG hybrid fallback strategy (no membership)
   - Updated Assumption 6: Context-aware autoplay behavior (desktop vs mobile)
   - Updated Assumption 7: Animation replay pattern (one-time + 3s + subtle loop)
   - Updated Assumption 8: Kolam design (sunburst/flower mandala with concentric circles)
   - All assumptions annotated with `*Clarification: ...`

3. **Functional Requirements** (UPDATED - 3 entries)
   - **FR-004** (UPDATED): Animation replay behavior detailed with 4-phase pattern
   - **FR-005a** (NEW): Context-aware autoplay requirement with device detection strategy
   - **FR-036** (UPDATED): SVG animation hybrid approach with primary DrawSVG + fallback
   - **FR-037** (UPDATED): Kolam design specification (sunburst/flower mandala, Tamil authentic)

## Architecture Decisions Established

### 1. Particle Rendering: Canvas 2D ✅

**Decision**: Canvas-based rendering for particles (200-500 total)

**Rationale**:

- Achieves 60fps on mid-range Android devices
- GPU acceleration via GSAP `force3D: true`
- Superior performance vs DOM-based rendering
- Supports complex particle physics and motion paths

**Technical Implication**: Canvas API required; no SVG particle rendering.

---

### 2. SVG Animation: Hybrid Fallback Strategy ✅

**Decision**: Attempt GSAP DrawSVG → fallback to custom strokeDasharray animation

**Rationale**:

- DrawSVG provides smooth SVG path drawing (ideal for kolam)
- No Club GreenSock membership purchase (cost constraint)
- Fallback strategy ensures resilience if DrawSVG unavailable
- Custom strokeDasharray + GSAP achieves similar visual effect

**Technical Implication**: Implement dual-strategy SVG renderer with feature detection.

---

### 3. Autoplay: Context-Aware Hybrid ✅

**Decision**: Autoplay on desktop, manual click on mobile

**Rationale**:

- Desktop: Wow factor from auto-animation on first page load
- Mobile: Respects battery/data constraints (critical on 3G networks)
- Device detection: User-agent or viewport size heuristics
- UX benefit: Prevents accidental autoplay data drain on mobile

**Technical Implication**: Implement device-detection utility; conditionally bind autoplay logic.

---

### 4. Animation Replay: Subtle Loop Pattern ✅

**Decision**: One-time play (8-12s) → 3s pause → subtle loop → replay button

**Rationale**:

- One-time play: Maintains narrative flow and emotional impact
- 3s pause: Gives user time to decide whether to replay
- Subtle loop (sparkles/particles): Maintains visual engagement without annoyance
- Replay button: Explicit user control for re-watching

**Technical Implication**: Implement 3-phase GSAP timeline: main animation → delay → background loop; add replay button component.

---

### 5. Pongal Kolam Design: Sunburst Mandala ✅

**Decision**: Sunburst/flower mandala pattern with concentric circles drawn radially outward

**Rationale**:

- Most recognizable traditional Tamil kolam pattern
- Natural reveal animation: circles drawing outward creates visual progression
- Cultural authenticity: Sunburst/mandala (vs geometric grids) best represents Tamil tradition
- Visual clarity: Concentric circles remain visually distinct on mobile

**Technical Implication**: Design sunburst drawing algorithm with GSAP MotionPath or custom SVG animation. Reference: Traditional Tamil kolam patterns.

## Integration Verification

### Specification Consistency Checks ✅

- [x] Clarifications section properly formatted (wiki standard)
- [x] All 5 decisions documented with session date
- [x] Assumptions updated to reflect clarifications
- [x] Functional requirements updated with clarification details
- [x] No conflicting specifications introduced
- [x] Canvas 2D decision propagated through particle requirements
- [x] DrawSVG fallback integrated into FR-036
- [x] Autoplay requirement added (FR-005a)
- [x] Animation replay pattern detailed in FR-004
- [x] Kolam design specification updated (FR-037)

### Architecture Validation ✅

- [x] Canvas 2D aligns with performance targets (60fps, mid-range Android)
- [x] Hybrid DrawSVG approach aligns with cost constraints (no membership)
- [x] Context-aware autoplay respects mobile battery/data constraints
- [x] Animation replay pattern prevents user fatigue while maintaining engagement
- [x] Sunburst kolam design aligns with cultural authenticity goal

### Downstream Artifacts ✅

- [x] `plan.md`: Existing roadmap remains compatible with all decisions
- [x] `tasks.md`: Existing implementation tasks remain valid (may need minor annotation)
- [x] `data-model.md`: No schema changes required (clarification A6: relationship context already available)
- [x] `contracts/animation.contracts.ts`: TypeScript interfaces compatible with all decisions
- [x] `contracts/API-REFERENCE.md`: API examples need minor annotation for hybrid strategies

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Implementation Preparation

1. **Task Annotation** (Recommended)
   - Review `tasks.md` and annotate with clarification references
   - Add implementation notes for hybrid SVG strategy
   - Mark device detection utilities as implementation dependency

2. **Technical Design Documents**
   - Create SVG animation renderer design (DrawSVG detection + fallback)
   - Create device detection utility specification
   - Create animation timeline orchestration spec (for subtle loop pattern)

3. **Implementation Kickoff**
   - Begin Phase 2 implementation with all clarifications in scope
   - Reference spec.md Clarifications section in all commits/PRs
   - Use FR-036, FR-037, FR-005a as source of truth for implementation

### Phase 2 Risk Mitigation

- **Canvas 2D Performance**: Physical device testing mandatory on mid-range Android (not emulator)
- **DrawSVG Fallback**: Implement feature detection; test both SVG strategies before merge
- **Context-Aware Autoplay**: Test on real mobile networks (not WiFi) to validate data savings
- **Animation Replay Loop**: Validate subtle loop doesn't cause UI jank; monitor paint times
- **Kolam Pattern**: Validate sunburst design renders correctly on mobile (test 320px viewport)
