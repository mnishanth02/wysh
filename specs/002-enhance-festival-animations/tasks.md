# Tasks: Enhanced Festival Greeting Animations

**Branch**: `002-enhance-festival-animations` | **Generated**: 2025-10-17
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-enhance-festival-animations/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Feature Summary**: Enhance Wysh greeting card animations for Diwali, New Year, and Pongal festivals with professional, high-performance animations using GSAP 3.13+. Each festival will have unique, culturally authentic animations with particle systems, motion paths, and timeline orchestration that adapt based on relationship context.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (US1-US6) to enable independent implementation and testing. Each user story is a complete, testable increment.

**Path Convention**: Wysh uses Next.js 15+ App Router structure:
- Components: `components/greetings/`, `components/ui/`
- Libraries: `lib/`, `lib/animations/`
- Types: `types/`
- Assets: `public/festivals/`

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1=Diwali, US2=New Year, US3=Pongal, US4=Context Adaptation, US5=Preview, US6=Fireworks)
- All tasks include exact file paths

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization, directory structure, and foundational animation utilities

- [ ] T118 [P] Optimize Canvas rendering: use requestAnimationFrame for render loop, batch draw calls, minimize context state changes
- [ ] T119 [P] Optimize SVG assets: run SVGO on all SVG files in `public/festivals/` to minimize file sizes, inline small SVGs (<2KB) into components
- [ ] T120 [P] Implement lazy loading for animation assets: use next/dynamic for heavy components, load particle systems on demand

### Accessibility Implementation

- [ ] T121 [P] Validate prefers-reduced-motion support across all templates: Diwali, New Year, Pongal, Fireworks all render simple fade-in alternative when media query is true
- [ ] T122 [P] Ensure WCAG AA color contrast for all text: verify recipientName, senderName, message text against animated backgrounds using contrast checker (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)
- [ ] T123 [P] Add ARIA labels to AnimationControls: aria-label="Play animation", "Pause animation", "Replay animation" for screen reader support
- [ ] T124 [P] Implement keyboard navigation in AnimationControls: verify Tab navigation, Space for play/pause, Enter for replay, Escape to close
- [ ] T125 [P] Add focus indicators to all interactive elements: visible outline on AnimationControls buttons when focused

### Browser Compatibility & Testing

- [ ] T126 [P] Cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop and mobile): verify animations render correctly, no visual artifacts
- [ ] T127 [P] Test on iOS Safari: verify GSAP animations work correctly, Canvas rendering performs well, no memory leaks
- [ ] T128 [P] Test on Android Chrome: verify 60fps performance on mid-range devices (2021+ Snapdragon 600), particle systems render smoothly
- [ ] T129 [P] Test network throttling (3G): verify greeting page loads in <2 seconds, animations don't block page render, lazy loading works correctly

### Integration & Workflow Testing

- [ ] T130 End-to-end test: create Diwali greeting ‚Üí select template ‚Üí preview animation ‚Üí finalize ‚Üí share ‚Üí view shared greeting (/g/[id]) ‚Üí verify animation plays correctly
- [ ] T131 End-to-end test: create New Year greeting with professional relationship ‚Üí verify muted colors and reduced intensity ‚Üí share ‚Üí confirm recipient sees adapted animation
- [ ] T132 End-to-end test: create Pongal greeting ‚Üí verify kolam drawing is culturally authentic ‚Üí share via WhatsApp ‚Üí confirm preview link shows animation
- [ ] T133 Regression test: verify existing Christmas, Holi, Generic templates still work correctly after animation system changes
- [ ] T134 Test animation replay workflow: load greeting ‚Üí watch animation ‚Üí click replay ‚Üí verify animation restarts smoothly without jank

### Documentation & Code Quality

- [ ] T135 [P] Add JSDoc comments to all animation classes and functions in `lib/animations/`: ParticleSystem, createAnimationTimeline, festival-themes functions
- [ ] T136 [P] Add inline comments explaining complex GSAP timeline sequencing in DiwaliTemplate, NewYearTemplate, PongalTemplate
- [ ] T137 [P] Create developer guide in `specs/002-enhance-festival-animations/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md`: how to create new festival animation, ParticleSystem usage, timeline patterns
- [ ] T138 [P] Update `specs/002-enhance-festival-animations/quickstart.md` with final setup instructions, testing commands, performance validation steps
- [ ] T139 [P] Add performance budgets to documentation: max 500KB per template code+assets, max 500 particles, min 45fps on mid-range devices
- [ ] T140 [P] Run biome linter and fix all errors: `bun run lint` in repo root, fix any animation-related linting issues

### Cultural Review & Constitution Compliance

- [ ] T141 **Cultural Review Gate** (Constitution Principle III): Review all festival animations with cultural experts. REQUIRED: (1) Tamil speaker to validate Pongal kolam pattern (sunburst/flower mandala) for cultural authenticity, (2) Cultural expert to validate Diwali color symbolism (#FF6B35 orange = saffron/spirituality, #FFA500 gold = prosperity, #DC143C red = auspiciousness, #FFFFFF white = purity), (3) Cultural expert to validate Pongal color meanings (#FF8C00 orange = harvest warmth, #FFEB3B yellow = turmeric/prosperity, #D2691E terracotta = earthen pot tradition). Document review feedback in `specs/002-enhance-festival-animations/CULTURAL-REVIEW.md`. BLOCKER: Feature cannot be marked production-ready until this gate passes.

**Checkpoint ‚úÖ**: All polish tasks complete, cultural review gate passed, feature ready for production

## Dependencies & Parallel Execution

### User Story Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup) ‚Üí Phase 2 (Foundation) ‚Üí Phase 3, 4, 5 (US1, US2, US3 - P1 stories)
                                       ‚Üì
                                   Phase 6 (US4 - depends on US1, US2, US3)
                                       ‚Üì
                                   Phase 7, 8 (US5, US6 - P2 stories)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP-First Approach

**Minimum Viable Product** = Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (US1: Diwali only)

This delivers:
- ‚úÖ Complete animation infrastructure (particle system, GSAP config, performance monitoring)
- ‚úÖ One fully functional festival animation (Diwali)
- ‚úÖ Relationship context adaptation
- ‚úÖ Prefers-reduced-motion support
- ‚úÖ Replay functionality

**Estimated MVP Time**: 2 weeks (10 working days)

### Incremental Delivery Phases

1. **Week 1-2**: Foundation + Diwali (MVP) ‚Üí Ship to production
2. **Week 3**: Add New Year ‚Üí Ship to production (2 festivals live)
3. **Week 4**: Add Pongal ‚Üí Ship to production (3 festivals live)
4. **Week 5-6**: Add US4, US5, US6 + Polish ‚Üí Final release

### Testing Strategy

**Per User Story** (independent testing):
- Load greeting with specific festivalType
- Verify animation completes full sequence
- Check 60fps performance on real device
- Test prefers-reduced-motion fallback
- Verify replay functionality

**Integration Testing** (after all stories complete):
- Test creation flow end-to-end
- Test WhatsApp sharing with animation preview
- Cross-browser and cross-device validation
- Performance regression testing
