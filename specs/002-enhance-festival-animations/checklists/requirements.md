### Validation Details

#### Content Quality Analysis

- **Implementation Details**: Specification uses only business/user language (e.g., "particles", "animation phases") without mentioning React components, GSAP plugins, or Canvas APIs. Technical requirements section explicitly states technology choices but doesn't leak implementation into functional requirements.
- **User-Focused Language**: All user stories written in "As a [user], when [action], so that [benefit]" format. Requirements describe business outcomes (e.g., "animation completes within 8-10 seconds", "60fps performance") not architectural patterns.
- **Stakeholder Readiness**: Non-technical stakeholders can understand: (1) three festival animations with unique visual themes, (2) performance targets (60fps on mobile), (3) accessibility support, (4) cultural authenticity requirement.

#### Requirement Completeness Analysis

- **Clarity Check**: All 74 functional requirements are specific and testable. Example: "FR-010: Diwali animation MUST use GSAP MotionPath to animate particles along curved bezier paths" - testable by observing particle motion trails. Fireworks template requirements (FR-047 through FR-060) enable reusability across multiple festival contexts.
- **Acceptance Scenarios**: Each P1/P2 user story includes 5-12 independent acceptance scenarios covering success paths and edge conditions. New User Story 6 (Fireworks template) includes 10 acceptance scenarios covering configuration, color adaptation, and context flexibility.
- **Edge Cases**: 8 edge cases identified including low-end devices, network failures, keyboard interactions, and motion preferences.
- **Assumptions**: 10 explicit assumptions documented covering rendering approach, library choices, browser support, testing methodology, and fallback strategies.

#### Success Criteria Analysis

- **Measurability**: All 10 success criteria are quantified:
  - SC-001: 60fps (0 dropped frames during 10s animation)
  - SC-002: Load time < 2 seconds on 4G
  - SC-003: 90%+ animation completion rate
  - SC-004: 80%+ share rate
  - SC-005: Lighthouse score > 85
  - SC-006: User rating > 4.5/5
  - SC-007: File size < 500KB
  - SC-008: WCAG AA compliance
  - SC-009: Prefers-reduced-motion variant < 3s
  - SC-010: Paint time < 8ms per frame
- **Technology-Agnostic**: No specific tool references (e.g., "Chrome DevTools" mentioned for measurement but not as implementation requirement). Criteria focus on outcomes (e.g., "load in under 2 seconds") not technical implementation.

#### Feature Scope Analysis

- **Clear Boundaries**: Three festivals explicitly named (Diwali, New Year, Pongal). "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes: sound, customization, additional festivals, video animations, analytics dashboard, A/B testing.
- **Priority Stratification**: Three P1 stories (core festival animations), two P2 stories (relationship adaptation, preview workflow). P1 stories are independently valuable MVPs.
- **Relationship Context Integration**: Detailed in FR-005 and User Story 4, building on existing context engine architecture mentioned in copilot-instructions.

### Coverage Summary

- **Functional Areas Covered**:
  - ✅ Animation system core (5 requirements)
  - ✅ Diwali animations (11 requirements)
  - ✅ New Year animations (15 requirements)
  - ✅ Pongal animations (15 requirements)
  - ✅ Fireworks template (14 requirements) - NEW
  - ✅ Performance optimization (5 requirements)
  - ✅ Accessibility (4 requirements)
  - ✅ Integration (5 requirements)
  - **Total: 74 functional requirements**

- **User Journey Coverage**:
  - ✅ Creator journey: Selection → Preview → Share
  - ✅ Recipient journey: View greeting → Watch animation → Share/Reply
  - ✅ Accessibility journey: Prefers-reduced-motion user experiences equivalent value
  - ✅ Fireworks template journey: Configurable multi-context animation usage
  - ✅ Edge cases: Low-end devices, network issues, motion preferences

- **Quality Gates**:
  - ✅ Animation timeline orchestration (GSAP timelines specified)
  - ✅ Performance budgets (60fps, <2s load, <500KB)
  - ✅ Cultural authenticity (Pongal specifically called out as hard requirement)
  - ✅ Accessibility (WCAG AA, pause/play, reduced motion)
  - ✅ Template reusability (Fireworks template enables multiple contexts)

## Notes

### What This Specification Delivers

1. **Clear Visual Narrative**: Each festival has distinct visual identity (fireworks/lights for Diwali, countdown/celebration for New Year, harvest elements for Pongal)
2. **Performance Contract**: 60fps target on 2021+ devices with graceful degradation strategy for older devices
3. **Relationship-Aware Design**: Single animation system adapts tone/intensity based on recipient relationship (professional/family/friends/romantic)
4. **Accessibility Foundation**: Prefers-reduced-motion support with equivalent experience, not degraded experience
5. **Cultural Respect**: Pongal animations explicitly require cultural authenticity with traditional kolam, terracotta pot, harvest elements

### Ready for Planning

This specification is **ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`** because:

1. ✅ All functional requirements are testable and non-redundant
2. ✅ Success criteria enable objective completion assessment
3. ✅ User scenarios provide independent MVPs
4. ✅ Performance, accessibility, and cultural requirements are explicit
5. ✅ Out-of-scope clearly defined to prevent scope creep
6. ✅ Implementation path clear without over-specifying architecture

### Key Implementation Considerations (For Planning Phase)

- Performance optimization critical path: Particle rendering strategy (Canvas vs WebGL) and frame rate validation on real devices
- Cultural consultation needed: Pongal kolam pattern design and authenticity review before animation implementation
- Animation timeline coordination: Multiple synchronized animation layers (particles, text, background, loops) require careful GSAP choreography
- Fireworks template architecture: Configurable, composable fireworks component that enables reuse across Diwali, New Year, and future celebration templates
- Relationship context integration: Requires coordination with existing context-engine.ts to ensure consistency with color/intensity adaptation
- Fireworks template configurability: Runtime parameter system (burst count, particle count, duration, colors) enables flexibility while maintaining performance
