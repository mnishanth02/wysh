## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*### User Story 1 - Create and Share Festival Greeting (Priority: P1)

A user arrives at Wysh, selects a festival (e.g., Diwali), chooses their relationship with the recipient (e.g., "Parents"), personalizes the greeting with names and an optional message, selects an animated template, and receives a shareable WhatsApp link to send their personalized greeting.

**Why this priority**: This is the complete end-to-end creator journey and represents the core value proposition. Without this, there is no product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a greeting from landing page to successful WhatsApp share and delivers immediate user value (personalized greeting sent to recipient).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user on the Wysh landing page, **When** they click "Create Your Festival Greeting" CTA, **Then** they are taken to festival selection screen
2. **Given** festival selection screen, **When** user selects "Diwali" from the visual grid, **Then** they proceed to relationship context selection
3. **Given** relationship context selection, **When** user selects "Parents" from Family category, **Then** they see the personalization form
4. **Given** personalization form, **When** user enters recipient name "Amma", sender name "Ravi", and leaves message blank, **Then** system generates contextual message appropriate for Diwali + Parents relationship
5. **Given** personalization complete, **When** user views template options, **Then** they see 3-4 Diwali templates with traditional colors and respectful animations suited for parents
6. **Given** template selection, **When** user taps preferred template and clicks "Create Greeting", **Then** system generates unique URL (format: wysh.zealer.in/g/[uniqueId])
7. **Given** successful generation, **When** success screen displays, **Then** user sees "Share on WhatsApp" button, "Copy Link" button, and preview option
8. **Given** WhatsApp share button clicked, **When** WhatsApp opens, **Then** it contains pre-filled message with greeting link
9. **Given** recipient opens link from WhatsApp, **When** greeting page loads, **Then** animation auto-plays with personalized names and culturally appropriate Diwali visuals

---

### User Story 2 - View Animated Greeting (Priority: P1)

A recipient receives a WhatsApp message with a Wysh greeting link, clicks it, and experiences a smooth, personalized animated greeting that loads quickly on their mobile device and displays their name with culturally authentic festival visuals.

**Why this priority**: Without a compelling recipient experience, the viral growth loop breaks. Recipients become creators, so this experience must delight.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening any generated greeting URL on mobile device and validates the complete viewing experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a greeting URL shared via WhatsApp, **When** recipient taps the link in WhatsApp, **Then** WhatsApp displays rich preview with Open Graph image and title
2. **Given** link opened in mobile browser, **When** greeting page loads, **Then** page weight is under 2MB and loads within 3 seconds on 3G connection
3. **Given** greeting page loaded, **When** page displays, **Then** animation auto-plays once for 5-8 seconds at 60fps on mid-range Android device
4. **Given** animation playing, **When** recipient views, **Then** they see their personalized name, custom or generated message, and festival-appropriate colors/symbols
5. **Given** animation completed, **When** greeting ends, **Then** subtle "Create Your Own Wysh" CTA appears at bottom
6. **Given** "Create Your Own Wysh" CTA clicked, **When** redirected, **Then** recipient lands on Wysh landing page (viral growth loop)

---

### User Story 3 - Mobile-First Responsive Experience (Priority: P1)

A user accesses Wysh from various mobile devices (320px to 768px screen widths) and experiences a seamlessly responsive interface optimized for touch interactions, with all features working smoothly regardless of device or screen size.

**Why this priority**: 85%+ of users are on mobile. If mobile experience fails, the product fails.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing all creation and viewing flows on different mobile screen sizes (small phone, large phone, tablet) and validates responsive design.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user on 320px width device (iPhone SE), **When** accessing landing page, **Then** all content is visible without horizontal scroll and sample greetings display correctly
2. **Given** user on 768px tablet, **When** accessing landing page, **Then** layout adapts with larger touch targets and optimized spacing
3. **Given** user on any mobile device, **When** interacting with festival selection grid, **Then** tap targets are minimum 44px x 44px for easy touch
4. **Given** user on mobile, **When** typing in personalization form, **Then** virtual keyboard does not obscure input fields
5. **Given** user on mobile, **When** viewing template previews, **Then** animations play smoothly at 60fps without stuttering
6. **Given** recipient on mid-range Android device, **When** viewing greeting, **Then** animations maintain 60fps (acceptable degradation to 30fps with progressive enhancement)

---

### User Story 4 - Festival and Relationship Context Engine (Priority: P2)

When a user selects a festival and relationship combination, the system dynamically adjusts the greeting's visual style, color palette, animation intensity, and message tone to match the cultural context and relationship formality level.

**Why this priority**: This is the key differentiator from generic greeting apps. It makes greetings feel personalized and culturally authentic, but the basic creation flow (P1) must work first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating greetings with different festival and relationship combinations and validating that visual style, colors, animations, and tone adapt appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user selects Diwali + Professional (Boss), **When** viewing templates, **Then** colors are muted (professional oranges/golds), animations are subtle (<3 seconds), and generated message uses formal language
2. **Given** user selects Holi + Friends (Close Friend), **When** viewing templates, **Then** colors are vibrant multi-color, animations are playful (5-8 seconds), and generated message uses casual language
3. **Given** user selects Christmas + Romantic (Partner), **When** viewing templates, **Then** colors are soft pastels, animations are elegant, and generated message uses intimate language
4. **Given** user selects Pongal + Family (Parents), **When** viewing templates, **Then** traditional Pongal colors are used, animations show respectful pacing, and message emphasizes family respect
5. **Given** user selects Generic Celebration + Colleague-Friend, **When** viewing templates, **Then** colors adapt to semi-formal style and message tone balances professional and friendly

---

### User Story 5 - Landing Page with Sample Greetings (Priority: P2)

A new user arrives at the Wysh landing page and immediately sees 2-3 auto-playing sample animated greetings showcasing different festivals and styles, along with a clear call-to-action to create their own greeting.

**Why this priority**: First impression drives conversion. Sample greetings communicate value instantly, but core creation flow (P1) must exist first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading landing page on mobile device and validates that samples auto-play and CTA is prominent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user lands on homepage, **When** page loads, **Then** 2-3 sample greetings are visible with auto-playing animations
2. **Given** samples displayed, **When** animations play, **Then** they showcase variety (e.g., Diwali professional, Holi friends, Christmas family)
3. **Given** samples playing, **When** user views page, **Then** animations loop subtly without being distracting
4. **Given** landing page displayed, **When** user looks for next action, **Then** prominent "Create Your Festival Greeting" CTA is visible above the fold
5. **Given** CTA button clicked, **When** user taps, **Then** they are immediately taken to festival selection screen

---

### User Story 6 - WhatsApp Sharing Optimization (Priority: P2)

When a user shares their greeting via WhatsApp, the link displays a rich preview with an attractive thumbnail, greeting title, and description that encourages recipients to click through.

**Why this priority**: WhatsApp is the primary sharing channel. Optimized previews increase click-through rates and viral growth, but basic sharing (P1) must work first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sharing greeting URLs via WhatsApp and validating Open Graph meta tag rendering in WhatsApp preview.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user clicks "Share on WhatsApp" button, **When** WhatsApp opens, **Then** pre-filled message includes greeting URL and contextual text (e.g., "I created a special Diwali greeting for you!")
2. **Given** greeting URL sent via WhatsApp, **When** recipient views message, **Then** WhatsApp displays rich preview with festival-appropriate thumbnail image
3. **Given** WhatsApp preview displayed, **When** recipient views, **Then** preview shows greeting title (e.g., "Happy Diwali from Ravi") and description
4. **Given** preview image shown, **When** recipient sees thumbnail, **Then** image is culturally appropriate, visually clear at small size, and represents the festival
5. **Given** recipient clicks preview, **When** link opens, **Then** greeting page loads with exact personalization shown in preview

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user enters extremely long names (>50 characters)? System MUST truncate gracefully and display validation message.
- What happens when a user selects a template but goes back to change relationship context? System MUST re-filter templates to match new relationship while preserving recipient name, sender name, and custom message.
- What happens when recipient's device has animations disabled in accessibility settings? System MUST show static greeting with all text content visible.
- What happens when greeting page is accessed on extremely slow connection? System MUST show loading state and degrade gracefully.
- What happens when recipient tries to access an invalid or expired greeting URL? System MUST display friendly "Greeting not found" message with CTA to create own greeting.
- What happens when user's device doesn't support WebP images? System MUST provide fallback image formats (PNG/JPEG).
- What happens when user clicks WhatsApp share on desktop device without WhatsApp installed? System MUST provide "Copy Link" alternative prominently.
- What happens when multiple users create greetings simultaneously? System MUST generate unique URLs without collisions.
- What happens when recipient views greeting on very old browser (IE11, Safari <12)? System MUST gracefully degrade to static experience.
- What happens when Convex database is unavailable during greeting creation? System MUST show user-friendly error message with automatic retry logic (up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff), then display "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later" message.
- What happens when Convex database is unavailable when recipient tries to view greeting? System MUST show "Greeting temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few moments" message and implement client-side retry.
- What happens when greeting creation times out (>30 seconds)? System MUST abort request, display error message, and allow retry.

### Assumptions

- Users have access to WhatsApp (primary sharing channel for Indian users)
- Users have stable internet connection for initial page load (3G or better)
- Mid-range Android device baseline: Snapdragon 600-series processor, 3GB RAM, Android 10+
- Festival color palettes and symbols have been validated by individuals familiar with each festival
- Generated contextual messages have been reviewed by native Tamil, Hindi, and English speakers
- Target audience is primarily Indian users or diaspora familiar with Indian festivals
- WhatsApp Web API for deep linking is accessible and functional; system has fallback (Copy Link) for unavailability
