## Architecture Decisions Validated

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Next.js 15 + React 19** | Server Components, React 19 hooks, Vercel integration | Remix, Nuxt, Astro |
| **Convex serverless** | Zero auth for MVP, local dev, type safety | Firebase, Supabase, custom API |
| **GSAP + Framer Motion** | GSAP for timelines, Framer for scroll/gestures | Single library (insufficient for both) |
| **Tailwind + shadcnui** | Utility-first CSS, headless components | Bootstrap, Material-UI, Chakra |
| **React Hook Form + zod** | Minimal bundle, TypeScript-first validation | Formik, Yup, react-final-form |
| **Monorepo (Next.js + Convex)** | Solo dev productivity, single CI/CD pipeline | Separate backend repository |
| **Mobile-first (320px-768px)** | 60fps animation targets, 2MB budget | Desktop-first approach |

---

## Constitution Compliance

**Status**: ✅ ALL 5 PRINCIPLES PASS (No violations, no unjustified complexity)

1. **Solo Developer Simplicity** ✅
   - Single monorepo with unified tooling
   - Convex eliminates need for separate API server
   - Component-based architecture with clear responsibilities

2. **Mobile-First Performance** ✅
   - GSAP + Framer Motion separated for optimal performance
   - 60fps animation target on mid-range Android validated
   - 2MB page weight budget with headroom documented

3. **Cultural Authenticity** ✅
   - Festival data separated from code (scalable)
   - Relationship context engine ensures tone matching
   - Color palettes and symbols documented with hex codes

4. **MVP-First Delivery** ✅
   - 5 festivals + generic template (not unlimited)
   - No auth, analytics dashboard, or photo upload
   - Vertical slicing by user story with real device testing required

5. **Privacy by Design** ✅
   - Minimal data collection (names + message only)
   - Anonymous view count tracking (no PII)
   - All greetings public by default, no auth required

---

## Requirements Alignment

**Feature Specification**: `spec.md` (6 user stories, 51 functional requirements, 14 success criteria)
**Clarifications**: All 5 ambiguities resolved and integrated

| Clarification | Resolution | Implementation Impact |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Database failures | Auto-retry with 3 attempts, exponential backoff (0ms, 500ms, 1.5s) | Documented in `contracts/api-contracts.md` |
| Form data preservation | React Hook Form maintains state in memory, no server session | No additional backend logic needed |
| Data retention | Indefinite storage in MVP (no auto-deletion) | Schema includes `expiresAt: null` field |
| Animation replay | Framer Motion variant system enables re-trigger | Replay button design in Phase 2 |
| View count privacy | Creator-only visibility, anonymous tracking | Query authorization pattern documented |

---

## Performance Targets Confirmed

| Metric | Target | Rationale | Verification Method |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Animation FPS | 60fps on Snapdragon 600-series | Mid-range Android device | Real device testing (not emulator) |
| Page Load | <3 seconds on 3G | Global audience accessibility | DevTools throttling (Slow 3G preset) |
| Greeting Creation | <60 seconds end-to-end | User frustration threshold | Manual stopwatch test |
| Page Weight | <2MB | Mobile data constraints | Network tab analysis after build |
| Lighthouse Score | >90 (all categories) | Quality baseline | CI/CD validation |

## Phase 2 Preparation

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Update Agent Context**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/nishanth/youtube-pre/wisher
   .specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh
   ```
   - Syncs planning decisions with agent system
   - Prepares for task generation

2. **Generate Task Breakdown** (when ready for implementation)
   - Execute `/speckit.tasks` command
   - Generates `tasks.md` with:
     - Granular tasks per user story
     - Implementation order and dependencies
     - File-by-file checklist
     - Estimated effort per task

3. **Code Generation Workflow**
   - Follow `quickstart.md` to set up local environment
   - Reference `data-model.md` for schema implementation
   - Use `contracts/api-contracts.md` as mutation/query specifications
   - Execute tasks in order from `tasks.md`

### Implementation Phases (Timeline)

- **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Infrastructure setup (Next.js, Convex, Tailwind)
- **Phase 2 (Week 1-2)**: Creation flow UI
- **Phase 3 (Week 2-3)**: Templates & animations
- **Phase 4 (Week 3-4)**: Storage & sharing
