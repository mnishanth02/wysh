# Tasks: Wysh Festival Greeting Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-festival-greeting-mvp/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-contracts.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT requested in the feature specification. All test tasks are excluded from this MVP implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web application structure**: Next.js App Router at root with embedded Convex backend
- All paths relative to: `/Users/nishanth/youtube-pre/wisher/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - User Story 1 (P1 - MVP): Can start after Foundational
  - User Story 2 (P1 - MVP): Can start after Foundational
  - User Story 3 (P1 - MVP): Can start after Foundational
  - User Story 4 (P2): Can start after Foundational
  - User Story 5 (P2): Can start after Foundational
  - User Story 6 (P2): Can start after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (Create & Share)**: No dependencies on other stories - can implement independently
- **User Story 2 (View Greeting)**: No dependencies on US1 but creates greeting URLs that US1 shares - can implement independently
- **User Story 3 (Mobile Responsive)**: Should be implemented alongside US1 and US2 (mobile-first approach)
- **User Story 4 (Context Engine)**: Enhances US1 and US2 - can implement independently
- **User Story 5 (Landing Samples)**: Depends on US2 templates being complete (reuses template components)
- **User Story 6 (WhatsApp Optimization)**: Enhances US1 sharing - can implement independently

### Within Each User Story

- Landing page before creation flow
- Festival selection before relationship selection before personalization before template
- Templates before greeting view page
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004, T005, T006, T008, T009, T010, T012, T013, T015, T016 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T020, T022, T023, T024, T026, T028, T030, T031, T032 can run in parallel after T018-T019
- **User Story 1**: T036-T038 (landing components) can run in parallel; within each section, [P] marked tasks can run in parallel
- **User Story 2**: T081-T086 (all festival templates) can run in parallel after T076-T080
- **User Story 3**: T105-T107 (responsive utilities) can run in parallel at start
- **User Story 4**: T129-T132 (context definitions) can run in parallel
- **User Story 5**: T154-T156 (sample components) can run in parallel
- **User Story 6**: T169-T172 (OG meta tags) can run in parallel
- **Polish**: T189-T190, T201-T202, T209-T211, T217-T218, T224-T225 can run in parallel

### Suggested MVP Scope (Week 1-3)

**Minimum Viable Product**: User Stories 1, 2, 3 (all P1)
- Complete creator journey (US1)
- Complete recipient journey (US2)
- Mobile-first responsive (US3)
- Total tasks: T001-T127 (127 tasks)
- Estimated time: 2-3 weeks for solo developer

**Extended MVP (Week 4-5)**: Add User Stories 4, 5, 6 (all P2)
- Context engine (US4)
- Landing samples (US5)
- WhatsApp optimization (US6)
- Total additional tasks: T128-T188 (61 tasks)
- Estimated time: +1-2 weeks

**Production-Ready (Week 6)**: Phase 9 Polish
- Error handling, performance, security, deployment
- Total additional tasks: T189-T242 (54 tasks)
- Estimated time: +1 week

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Create & Share)

```bash
# Step 1: After foundational phase, start landing page components in parallel:
T036 - Create landing page (developer A)
T037 - Create navigation component (developer B)
T038 - Create footer component (developer C)

# Step 2: Creation flow sections can proceed sequentially, but within each section:
# Festival selection
T040 - Create festival page (developer A)
T041 - Create FestivalSelector component (developer A continues)
T042 - Fetch festivals query (developer A continues)

# Relationship selection (can start once T040-T042 mostly done)
T045 - Create relationship page (developer B)
T046 - Create RelationshipSelector (developer B continues)

# And so on through the creation flow...

# Step 3: Final integration
T064 - Call createGreeting mutation (developer A)
T065-T066 - Handle retry and success (developer A continues)
T067-T072 - Build success page (developer A continues)
T073-T075 - WhatsApp integration (developer B can work in parallel)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach

1. **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup) and Phase 2 (Foundational)
   - Goal: Solid foundation with working Convex backend
   - Checkpoint: Can query festivals and create/retrieve greetings via Convex dashboard

2. **Week 2**: Implement User Story 1 (Create & Share) - P1 MVP
   - Goal: End-to-end creator journey functional
   - Checkpoint: Can create greeting and generate WhatsApp share link

3. **Week 2-3**: Implement User Story 2 (View Greeting) - P1 MVP
   - Goal: Recipient can view animated greetings
   - Checkpoint: At least Diwali and Holi templates working with 60fps animations

4. **Week 3**: Implement User Story 3 (Mobile Responsive) - P1 MVP
   - Goal: All flows work on mobile (320px-768px)
   - Checkpoint: Tested on real iPhone and Android device

5. **Week 4**: Implement User Stories 4-6 (P2 enhancements)
   - Goal: Context engine, landing samples, WhatsApp optimization
   - Checkpoint: Platform differentiated from generic greeting apps

6. **Week 5**: Phase 9 (Polish & Deploy)
   - Goal: Production-ready with error handling, performance, security
   - Checkpoint: Deployed to production with monitoring

### Solo Developer Focus

- Prioritize P1 user stories (1, 2, 3) for MVP
- Use P2 user stories (4, 5, 6) as post-launch enhancements
- Leverage [P] markers for task batching (do all parallel tasks together)
- Test on real device frequently (not just DevTools)
- Deploy early and often (use Vercel preview deployments)
