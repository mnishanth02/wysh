## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Specification maintains abstraction from implementation:
- Uses "System MUST" language without mentioning specific technologies
- Focuses on user capabilities and business value
- Edge cases describe user-facing scenarios
- Success criteria are outcome-focused

✅ **Pass** - Written for stakeholder understanding:
- User stories written in plain language
- Cultural requirements clearly explained
- Business metrics clearly defined (viral growth, engagement)

✅ **Pass** - All mandatory sections present:
- User Scenarios & Testing (6 prioritized user stories)
- Requirements (51 functional requirements organized by category)
- Success Criteria (14 measurable outcomes)
- Key Entities defined
- Edge Cases documented
- Assumptions documented
- Out of Scope section clarifies boundaries

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - No clarification markers:
- All requirements are concrete and actionable
- Cultural color palettes specified with hex codes
- Performance targets defined (60fps, 2MB, 3 seconds)
- Screen width ranges specified (320px-768px)

✅ **Pass** - Requirements are testable:
- Each FR uses "MUST" with specific capability
- Cultural authenticity requirements specify exact colors and symbols
- Performance requirements include measurable thresholds
- User journey requirements map to specific UI interactions

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria are measurable:
- Time-based: "under 60 seconds", "10-15 seconds", "within 3 seconds"
- Percentage-based: "70% or more", "30% or more", "below 10%"
- Count-based: "100 or more unique greetings"
- Technical metrics: "60fps", "2MB", "95% or more"

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic:
- No mention of frameworks or libraries in SC section
- Focused on user outcomes ("Users can create...", "Greeting view pages load...")
- Business metrics ("viral growth loop", "bounce rate")
- Cultural authenticity focus (not implementation)

✅ **Pass** - Acceptance scenarios comprehensive:
- Each user story has 5-9 detailed Given-When-Then scenarios
- Scenarios cover happy paths and key variations
- End-to-end flows well-documented (creator and recipient journeys)

✅ **Pass** - Edge cases identified:
- 9 edge cases covering validation, error handling, accessibility, performance, browser compatibility
- Each describes user-facing failure scenario and expected system behavior

✅ **Pass** - Scope clearly bounded:
- "Out of Scope for MVP" section explicitly lists 20 excluded features
- Technical constraints defined ("Must Have" vs "Nice to Have")
- MVP festival set limited to 6 festivals

✅ **Pass** - Dependencies and assumptions documented:
- 12 assumptions clearly stated (WhatsApp access, device baselines, cultural validation, etc.)
- Infrastructure assumptions defined (Convex, Vercel capacity)
- Cultural validation dependencies noted

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Requirements have acceptance criteria:
- 51 functional requirements each map to user stories
- Cultural requirements tied to specific festivals
- Technical requirements support performance success criteria

✅ **Pass** - User scenarios cover primary flows:
- P1 stories cover complete creator journey (create & share)
- P1 stories cover recipient viewing experience
- P1 stories cover mobile-first requirement
- P2 stories cover differentiation features (context engine, landing page, WhatsApp optimization)

✅ **Pass** - Measurable outcomes defined:
- 14 success criteria covering creation time, performance, engagement, virality
- Mix of user experience, technical, and business metrics
- Baseline targets for MVP launch (100 greetings, 70% WhatsApp usage, 30% viral conversion)

✅ **Pass** - No implementation leakage:
- Spec focuses on WHAT (capabilities) not HOW (technology)
- Cultural requirements describe visual outcomes, not CSS/styling
- Animation requirements describe user experience, not library usage

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete with all mandatory sections
- Testable with unambiguous requirements
- Measurable with concrete success criteria
- Technology-agnostic focusing on user value
- Culturally authentic with detailed festival requirements
- Properly scoped for MVP delivery

**Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
2. Consider cultural review with festival celebrants during planning phase
3. Performance profiling plan needed for animation validation

## Notes

**Strengths**:
- Exceptional cultural authenticity detail (color palettes with hex codes, symbol specifications)
- Strong focus on mobile-first with specific device baselines
- Well-defined viral growth loop with measurable metrics
- Clear relationship context engine differentiation
- Comprehensive edge case coverage

**Considerations for Planning Phase**:
- Animation performance validation will require actual device testing strategy
- WhatsApp deep linking may need platform-specific handling (iOS vs Android)
- Contextual message generation algorithm will need linguistic review
- Festival cultural validation gates should be built into development workflow
