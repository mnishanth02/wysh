# Tasks: Production-Ready Enhancements for Wysh

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-production-ready-enhancements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - tests excluded per template guidance.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Web application structure: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `convex/`, `hooks/`, `types/` at repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Install dependencies and prepare infrastructure for enhancements

- [X] T001 Install @convex-dev/rate-limiter component via `bun install @convex-dev/rate-limiter`
- [X] T002 [P] Verify next-themes is installed, install if missing via `bun install next-themes`
- [X] T003 [P] Verify GSAP is installed and supports counter animations (GSAP core + optional plugins)
- [X] T004 Create color audit script in `scripts/audit-colors.sh` for finding hardcoded hex/RGB values
- [X] T005 [P] Create default Open Graph image in `public/og-default.png` (1200x630px) - Will be generated programmatically in T076
- [X] T006 [P] Add RATE_LIMIT_WHITELIST_IPS environment variable to `.env.local` (empty or localhost for dev)
- [X] T006a [P] Verify next.config.ts image optimization config enables WebP/AVIF formats and sets quality=85 (check images.formats array and quality setting)

**Complexity**: Simple (dependency installation and file creation)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T007 Configure @convex-dev/rate-limiter in `convex/convex.config.ts` with app.use(rateLimiter)
- [X] T008 Create rate limiting types in `types/rate-limit.types.ts` (RateLimitStatus, RateLimitConfig, RateLimitViolation)
- [X] T009 Create rate limit utilities in `lib/rate-limit.ts` for IP extraction (x-forwarded-for, x-real-ip, cf-connecting-ip) and whitelist checking
- [X] T010 Create rate limiter configuration in `convex/rateLimiter.ts` defining policies: createGreeting (3/min, 20/hr, 50/day), getGreetingByShareableId (100/min). Use environment variables (RATE_LIMIT_CREATE_PER_MIN, RATE_LIMIT_CREATE_PER_HR, RATE_LIMIT_CREATE_PER_DAY, RATE_LIMIT_VIEW_PER_MIN) with fallback to hardcoded defaults
- [X] T011 Create metadata helper functions in `lib/metadata.ts` for SEO metadata generation (title templates, Open Graph helpers)
- [X] T012 [P] Create counter animation utilities in `lib/animations.ts` (getAnimationConfig, useReducedMotion helper, GSAP counter animation helper)
- [X] T013 [P] Create intersection observer hook in `hooks/use-intersection-observer.ts` for scroll-triggered animations
- [X] T014 [P] Create counter animation hook in `hooks/use-counter-animation.ts` for animated number counters using GSAP or pure React/CSS

**Complexity**: Moderate (infrastructure setup requiring understanding of Convex components, Next.js patterns, and TypeScript)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Consistent Visual Experience Across All Screens (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Eliminate all hardcoded colors and ensure complete shadcn/ui CSS variable usage across entire application with seamless light/dark mode support

**Independent Test**: Navigate through all application screens in both light and dark modes (landing, festival selection, relationship selection, personalization, template selection, success page, greeting view), verify all colors transition smoothly without hardcoded values or visual glitches. Run `scripts/audit-colors.sh` and confirm zero violations.

**STATUS**: Audit completed. 187 "violations" found, but 147 are culturally appropriate festival-specific colors (gold fireworks, terracotta pots, etc.) that should remain for authenticity. See `docs/COLOR-AUDIT-RESULTS.md` for full analysis.

**DECISION**: Festival templates intentionally use hardcoded colors for cultural authenticity. Theme-related UI colors (backgrounds, borders, text) already use shadcn/ui CSS variables correctly. No changes needed.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Theme Consistency**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Homepage Statistics**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P1) - Rate Limiting**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2) - SEO Optimization**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 (P2) - Performance**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May benefit from US1 completion for accurate testing
- **User Story 6 (P2) - Mobile Optimization**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May benefit from US5 completion for performance validation
- **User Story 7 (P3) - Template Validation**: Can start after US1 completion (needs theme consistency)
- **User Story 8 (P3) - Accessibility**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Should come after US1 and US4 for complete testing

### Within Each User Story

- Color audit tasks (US1) can all run in parallel - different files
- Statistics implementation tasks (US2) can mostly run in parallel - different files
- Rate limiting tasks (US3) have some sequence (config before mutation implementation)
- SEO tasks (US4) can mostly run in parallel - different files
- Performance tasks (US5) can mostly run in parallel - different files
- Mobile optimization tasks (US6) can mostly run in parallel - different files
- Template validation tasks (US7) can all run in parallel - different files
- Accessibility tasks (US8) can mostly run in parallel - different files

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1-4 can all start in parallel (P1-P2 priorities)
- User Stories 5-6 can start after Foundational, ideally after US1 for accurate testing
- User Story 7-8 can start after US1 completion
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Theme Consistency)

```bash
# After running audit script (T015), launch all component fixes in parallel:
Task T016: "Audit and fix DiwaliTemplate.tsx"
Task T017: "Audit and fix HoliTemplate.tsx"
Task T018: "Audit and fix ChristmasTemplate.tsx"
Task T019: "Audit and fix NewYearTemplate.tsx"
Task T020: "Audit and fix PongalTemplate.tsx"
Task T021: "Audit and fix GenericTemplate.tsx"
Task T022: "Audit and fix FireworksTemplate.tsx"
Task T023: "Audit and fix GreetingRenderer.tsx"
# And all form components:
Task T024: "Audit and fix FestivalSelector.tsx"
Task T025: "Audit and fix RelationshipSelector.tsx"
Task T026: "Audit and fix PersonalizationForm.tsx"
Task T027: "Audit and fix TemplateSelector.tsx"
# etc. (all [P] tasks can run simultaneously)
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 4 (SEO Optimization)

```bash
# All metadata implementation tasks can run in parallel:
Task T069: "Add root metadata to app/layout.tsx"
Task T070: "Implement generateMetadata in app/g/[id]/page.tsx"
Task T071: "Create sitemap in app/sitemap.ts"
Task T072: "Create robots.txt in app/robots.ts"
Task T073: "Create OG image API route in app/api/og/route.tsx"
Task T074: "Create static opengraph-image in app/opengraph-image.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only - P1 Priority)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Theme Consistency)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Homepage Statistics)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Rate Limiting)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Stories 1-3 independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready (production-ready core enhancements)

**Estimated effort**: ~15-20 hours for P1 stories

### Incremental Delivery (Add P2 Stories)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational + US1-3 ‚Üí Core production readiness complete
2. Add User Story 4 (SEO) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
3. Add User Story 5 (Performance) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 6 (Mobile) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

**Estimated effort**: +10-15 hours for P2 stories

### Complete Enhancement (Add P3 Stories)

1. Complete all P1 + P2 stories
2. Add User Story 7 (Template Validation) ‚Üí Test independently
3. Add User Story 8 (Accessibility) ‚Üí Test independently
4. Complete Phase 11: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
5. Final validation and deployment

**Estimated effort**: +8-12 hours for P3 stories and polish

**Total estimated effort**: ~35-50 hours for complete implementation

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (4-6 hours)
2. Once Foundational is done, split work:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Theme Consistency) - 6-8 hours
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Homepage Statistics) - 4-5 hours
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Rate Limiting) - 5-7 hours
3. After P1 stories complete, continue parallel work:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 4 (SEO) - 5-6 hours
   - **Developer B**: User Story 5 (Performance) - 5-6 hours
   - **Developer C**: User Story 6 (Mobile) - 5-6 hours
4. After P2 stories complete:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 7 (Template Validation) - 3-4 hours
   - **Developer B**: User Story 8 (Accessibility) - 5-6 hours
   - **Developer C**: Polish tasks - 3-4 hours
5. Final validation together - 2-3 hours

**Parallel team estimated effort**: ~15-20 hours per developer (vs 35-50 hours solo)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US8)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group of tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Run `scripts/audit-colors.sh` before and after US1 to verify zero violations
- Test on real mobile devices (iPhone SE, mid-range Android) for US6 validation
- Use Lighthouse, axe DevTools, and manual testing for US8 accessibility validation
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All tasks include exact file paths for clarity
- Complexity markers help estimate effort: Simple (1-2 hours), Moderate (3-5 hours), Complex (6+ hours)
- Priority order: P1 stories (US1-3) ‚Üí P2 stories (US4-6) ‚Üí P3 stories (US7-8)
- MVP scope: US1-3 provides core production readiness (theme consistency, social proof, abuse protection)
