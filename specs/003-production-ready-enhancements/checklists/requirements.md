# Specification Quality Checklist: Production-Ready Enhancements for Wysh

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 19, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Validation Date**: October 19, 2025
**Status**: âœ… ALL CHECKS PASSED

### Summary

All specification quality criteria have been met. The specification is:

- Complete and comprehensive with 8 prioritized user stories (P1-P3)
- Technology-agnostic with no implementation details
- Testable with 70 functional requirements and 34 measurable success criteria
- Well-scoped with clear boundaries and exclusions
- Production-ready with detailed assumptions and dependencies documented

### Key Strengths

1. **Prioritized User Stories**: Clear P1/P2/P3 prioritization allows for phased implementation
2. **Measurable Success Criteria**: Every SC has specific metrics (percentages, time limits, counts)
3. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 70 FRs covering all aspects of production readiness
4. **Well-Defined Scope**: Explicit out-of-scope section prevents scope creep
5. **Industry Best Practices**: Informed assumptions based on shadcn/ui docs, Next.js SEO patterns, and Upstash rate limiting

### Ready for Next Phase

The specification is ready for:

- `/speckit.clarify` if stakeholder questions arise
- `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan

## Notes

No issues or concerns identified. Specification quality exceeds requirements.
